<p>STUDENT ENROLLMENT AGREEMENT</p>

<p>THIS IS A LEGALLY BINDING INSTRUMENT WHEN YOU CHECK THE BOX THAT YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.</p>

<p>REFUND POLICY, TIME LIMITATIONS AND OTHER FEES REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A CONTRACTORS LICENSE</p>

<p>If for any reason the student wishes to cancel, the student may do so by notifying Contractors Intelligence School in writing within 5 business days from the date the package is delivered.&nbsp; If the student cancels, they must mail unopened study material back to Contractors Intelligence School within 14 calendar days of the delivery at their expense and the student will receive a refund (less the shipping cost and 25% re-stocking fee if package was shipped out). &nbsp;The refund will be issued within 30 days of the withdrawal.&nbsp; <span class="marker"><span style="background-color:#FFFFFF">AFTER 14 BUSINESS DAYS THE STUDENT WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR A REFUND UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEPT UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GUARANTEE BELOW</span></span>.&nbsp; Contractors Intelligence School agrees to provide the student with updated material for a six month period.&nbsp; If the student does not complete the course during this time period, the enrollment is void and no refund is due to the student. If it has been less than 1 year, the student may pay a non-refundable $85.00 enrollment extension fee that will extend the enrollment for an additional six month period from the day the extension is paid. If it has been more than one year since the student has enrolled, they will have to pay 50% of the course price to re-enroll.&nbsp; Other fees NOT included in tuition: SHIPPING AND HANDLING, STATE APPLICATION FEE: $300.00 (Paid directly to the state with the application.), <span class="marker">FINGERPRINTING: Approximately $66.00, STATE LICENSE FEE: $180.00 (Paid directly to the state after the student passes the exam.), CONTRACTOR’S BOND</span>: approx. $115 per year.&nbsp; This bond is required after the student passes the test. If the student is obtaining a C-39 (roofing) or a C-53 (swimming pool) license, the bond may cost considerably more. If the student has had a contractors license suspended or revoked in the past, a disciplinary bond may be required, which is extremely expensive and varies depending on a number of factors. All of these fees are subject to change without notice. Applicant must also have 4 years of experience within the 10 years preceding the application.</p>
